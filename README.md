## Predicting forex binary options using time series data and machine learning

Here we'll get past forex data and apply a model to predict if the market will close red or green in the following timestamps.

I want to credit [@hayatoy](https://github.com/hayatoy) with the project [ml-forex-prediction](https://github.com/hayatoy/ml-forex-prediction) under the [MIT License](https://github.com/hayatoy/ml-forex-prediction/blob/master/LICENSE). I was inspired to use a Gradient Boosting Classifier by this project, which was implemented using Python 2 and Yahoo Finance.


### About the data

* The csv files were extracted from [Dukascopy](https://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/marketwatch/historical/).
